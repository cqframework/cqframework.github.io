Archived information about the CQF Initiative (charter, members, pilots, and meetings) can be found on the ONC Tech Labs Clinical Quality Framework Initiative site.</p> <p>The effort focuses on two primary use cases:</p> <ol> <li>Representation and distribution of knowledge artifacts (rules, order sets, documentation templates, measures, etc)</li> <li>Evaluation of knowledge</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#getting-involved","title":"Getting Involved","text":"<p>The HL7 Confluence has an overview of the Clinical Quality Framework.</p> <p>The Clinical Quality Framework github organization hosts tooling and content development projects related to Clinical Quality Framework.</p> <p>See the Projects page for information on some of the projects hosted by CQF.</p> <p>The FHIR Zulip CQL has many members of CQF participating.
